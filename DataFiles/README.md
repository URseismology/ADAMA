###### Master List for Stations
All stations we are working with along with their coordinates are stored in the file all_sta_in_notin_Africa.csv. The In_africa column indicates whether the station is on the African continent. 

###### The two csv prepross_connection files here are derived from the original pre-processed connection file:

(0): all connections in the original pp connection file with distance_km > 60 
(1): all connections in (0) that have at least one station in the pair having comp as [1,2,Z]
