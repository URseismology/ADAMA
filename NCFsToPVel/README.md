## NCFs to Phase Velocity
Scripts that use NCFs from 4 above, converted to ASCII files, and produce phase velocities Co. Again, SLURM bash scripts that run the whole process using the HPC system.
- run01code.sh & run01code.slurm: run Aki01 code in parallel. 
- run02code.sh & run02code.slurm: run Aki02 code in parallel. 
- run03code.sh & run03code.slurm: run Aki03 code in parallel.
