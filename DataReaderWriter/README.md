Data Readers and Writers (MATLAB & Python): 
1. buildADAMAncf.m – compiles the dataset from ncf results
	2. read_ADAMA_ncfs.m – read in the ncf of a station pair as HDF5 files.
	3. buildADAMAraw.py – compiles the dataset from raw AkiEstimate files
	4. read_ADAMA_raw.m – read in the Aki phase velocity as HDF5 files. 
	5. buildADAMAclean.m – convert dispersion results to ASCII files.
