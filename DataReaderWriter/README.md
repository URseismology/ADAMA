## Data Reader and Writer

Codes to build and read from HDF5 files (MATLAB & Python): 

1. buildADAMAncf.m – compiles the dataset from ncf results
2. read_ADAMA_ncfs.m – read in the ncf of a station pair as HDF5 files.
3. buildADAMAraw.py – compiles the dataset from raw AkiEstimate files
4. read_ADAMA_raw.m – read in the Aki phase velocity as HDF5 files. 
5. buildADAMAclean.m – convert dispersion results to ASCII files.
